I studied chemical engineering for three years and I took a few coding classes. Then after graduating some friends began to pursue a career as web developers and they really recommended it to me because they thought I would like it. 
So I decided to try it and I came across the flatiron free coding bootcamp prep course and I loved it. I really enjoyed learning to code and learning about how everything works. I really enjoy approaching each project as a puzzle that I'm solving piece by piece and seeing the it all come together at the end!
