Loops are very useful. They gives us a way to write code efficiently. 
But what's instersting about loops is that on their own they can break out program!
If we aren't careful they can take us to an infinte never ending loop that we cannot get out of.
That's why it's so important to include a break in our loop. This is such a simple subtle part of loop but it is very crucial.
Unless we want to be thrown into the realm of infinity we must not forget the *break*!!
